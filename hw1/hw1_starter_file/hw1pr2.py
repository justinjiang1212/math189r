"""
Start file for hw1pr2 of Big Data Summer 2017

Before attemping the problem, please familiarize with pandas and numpy
libraries. Tutorials can be found online:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

This file only has one part: the main driver.

First, fill in the solution you obtained from part (a) in part (c) of the
main driver to generate plot for part (c).

Please COMMENT OUT part(d) in main driver before you finish that step.
Otherwise, you won't be able to run the program because of errors.

Note:
1. You must finish the first two parts (math part) of this problem before
   attempting the coding part.

2. Please read the instructions and hints carefully, and use the name of the
variables we provided, otherwise, the function may not work.

3. Placeholder values are given for the variables needed, they need to be
   replaced with your own code

3. Remember to comment out the TODO comment after you finish each part.
